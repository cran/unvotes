#' United Nations General Assembly voting data by country and roll call
#'
#' Information on the voting history of the United Nations General Assembly.
#' Contains one row for each country-vote pair.
#'
#' @format A data frame (specifically a tbl_df) with one row
#' for each country-vote pair, and the following columns:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{rcid}{The roll call id; used to join with \code{\link{un_roll_calls}}
#'   and \code{\link{un_roll_call_issues}}}
#'   \item{country}{Country name, by official English short name}
#'   \item{country_code}{2-character ISO country code}
#'   \item{vote}{Vote result as a factor of yes/abstain/no}
#' }
#'
#' @details The original data included cases where a country was absent
#' or was not yet a member. In this dataset these were filtered out to
#' include only votes of Yes, Abstain, and No.
#'
#' Country name can be converted to other unique country identifiers
#' (such as 2-character or 3-character ISO codes) using the
#' \link[countrycode]{countrycode} function from the countrycode
#' package.

#'
#' # combine with issue
#' votes_issues <- un_votes %>%
#'   inner_join(un_roll_call_issues, by = "rcid")
